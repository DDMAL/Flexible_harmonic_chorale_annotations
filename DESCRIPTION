Description: This package is a companion to the paper presented at the International
  Society of Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) 2018 conference entitled "A Flexible Approach to Automated
  Harmonic Analysis: Multiple Annotations of Chorales by Back and Praetorius" (Condit-Schultz, Ju, and Fujinaga) The package
  includes several collections of data and tools for generating harmonic analysis data, as
  described in that paper. The data includes "raw" humdrum/kern files of 572 chorales by
  J.S. Bach and M. Praetorius, as well as a wide variety of useful features parsed from this
  data, saved as RData objects. Most importantly, the package includes another RData object
  which encodes a large number of alternative harmonic analyses of these chorales, a
  set of functions which can be used to "filter" these possibilities to get specific analyses,
  and functions to output these analyses as humdrum files, aligned with the original kern data.
